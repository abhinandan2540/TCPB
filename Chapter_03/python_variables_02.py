# x = 3
# y = 'avv'

# print(x)
# print(y)

# rule 1 : python variable case sensitive
# age = 20
# Age = 20
# AGE = 20

# print(age)
# print(Age)
# print(AGE)

# rule 2: variable naming should start with words not with numebrs
# My2Name = "avv"
# 2MyName = 'avv'
# print(My2Name)
# print(2MyName)

# rule 3: in variable naming, only we can use A-z,0-9,_

# my2name = 'avv'
# my_name = 'avv'
# # my-name = 'avv'
# # my & name = 'avv'

# print(my2name)
# print(my_name)
# # print(my-name)
# # print(my & name)


# rule 4: don't use python keyword for creating variable name

# name = 'avv'
# # while = 'avv'

# print(name)
# # print(while)


# variable naming culture:
# 1. pascal case naming
# 2. camel case naming
# 3. snake case naming


# 1. pascal case :
MyVariableName = 'pascal'
print(MyVariableName)

# 2. camelcase :
myVariableName = "camel"
print(myVariableName)

# 3. snake case:
my_variable_name = 'snake'
print(my_variable_name)
